Juan is an open source discord bot which has an integrity on its own. Because it is under development and yet finished nor being
closed to be finished some inconsistancies with its behavior should be expected. Thus, inviting jaun. to your discord server is
not avaiable right now. However, if you want you can host your own juan bot.
